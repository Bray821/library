# Library
A web app to track your progress on books you are reading.

See it live [here.](https://ramanjs.github.io/library/)

## Note
It uses local storage to store user data on the device. Clearing the browser data will also clear the local storage. Altenatively, running `localStorage.clear()` in the browser console will do the same.
